# Natural Disaster Information System (NDIS) – Geohazard Mission Planning

This repository documents the end-to-end geospatial preprocessing and decision logic pipeline used in the Natural Disaster Information System (NDIS). The system supports drone-based (RPAS) hazard survey planning by integrating multi-source geohazard datasets, performing spatial analysis, and applying both rule-based and machine learning-based decision workflows.
